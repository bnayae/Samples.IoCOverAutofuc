Presentation order:
- Contract
- Components

- At this stage TheLogic.cs is ready for testing
	Discuss the need of Mocking (slides)

- Testing (TheLogicTests.cs)
  Testing can happens before having the Infra or provider implementation
  this test don't need Autofac (constructor injection) 

- Infra (discuss the deep dependencies chain)
- WinEventLogProvider (another example of deep dependencies chain)
- TraceLogProvider (Open close principle allow to add extension without changing the infra - IoC help to resolve dependencies)
- FileConfigProvider (can be replaced at any time with DB or Service implementation)

- Show the [Dependency Map.dgml] see that there is no concrete 
	dependencies between non hosting components (all goes via the Contracts)

- Hosting (the only place where Autofac is used)
